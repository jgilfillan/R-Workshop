# R-Workshop
	
I want to give the team a bit of a knowledge transfer on how I use R.  Topics I hope to cover:

* Why R?
* Getting R help
  * ?
  * CRAN
  * Stack overflow
  * Hacky hour
* Reading and writing data
  *  from CSV/Excel
  * from Oracle DW
    * ROracle+ sistools packages
* Data Wrangling
  * Base R
  * dplyr and the tidyverse
* Plotting with ggplot2
* Rstudio tips
  * Projects
  * Snippets

We probably won't cover all of this in one session, so will book another one if needed.  If possible please come with a laptop installed with R and RStudio.

Also run the following commands in R prior to attending:

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("keyringr")
install.packages("G:/qua/Planning and Statistics/Script Templates and Headers/001. R Packages/sistools_0.6.0.zip", repos = NULL)

Please print out and bring the following cheat sheets from https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/:

* Data import
* Data transformation
* Data visualization
